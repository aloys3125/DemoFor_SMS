Demo website for Smart Meeting Summarizer

A Full-Stack NLP Web App for Auto-Summarizing Meeting Transcripts

This repository features the Smart Meeting Summarizer, a full-stack web application that leverages Natural Language Processing to convert long meeting transcripts into concise, actionable summaries. Built with a user-first approach, this project demonstrates both backend intelligence and frontend polish.

Note: Due to hosting limitations of large NLP models, the working backend is demonstrated via a screen recording of the local application.
